Coding is, generally speaking, about as granular of an activity as one can partake in, as so because of that, trying to learn about different aspects of it can be extremely intimidating. Not only beacause the concepts themselves can be extremely challenging, but also because a lot of the time they require some prexisting knowledge in order to be implemented effectively. And so, a lot of times the best way to solve a problem you might be having is to ask someone who knows more than you for some help in explaing how to do something or why something behaves the way it does. In that, however, lies a problem, as you dont want to waste either you time or those who are helping you's time. The solution to that problem is to ask questions the "smart way"


## What is a "smart question"?


A smart question, according to the essay, is one that is clear, well-researched, and respectful, allowing the person being asked to provide an informed and helpful response. It demonstrates that the asker has made an effort to understand the problem and explored possible solutions before seeking help. This includes providing relevant details, stating the issue clearly, and asking for specific guidance rather than a vague answer. A smart question shows the askerâ€™s consideration for the responder's time and expertise.

## Example of a smart question
A great example of a smart question can be found [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array) The basic idea that the person who asked the question is trying to get answered is "Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?", and while that is a good basis for a question if you do not know the answer, it is all the other pieces of the puzzle that make it a true smart question. He first describes what he obeserved in that his code was processing faster with a sorted array as opposed to a non sorted array. He then showed that he tested a few theories on his own as to why that might be happening, like maybe it was a compiler issue, or maybe that it already brought the data to the cache, but he concluded that those were not the answers. He finished by clarifying what exactly he would like answered, specifiaclly what is happening in the code snippet he provided and why does having a sorrted array effect proccessing speed. Because he asked a clear question and showed that he clearly tried to figure it out on his own, he was rewarded with a great response from one of the users of the website about how branch prediciting works in computer and how that would effect proccessing speeds.


## Example of a non-smart question

A non smart question is one that does not respect either the asker or the answerers time. An example of this can be found [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32825433/how-can-i-count-the-number-of-times-each-word-appears-in-a-txt-file) The Person asking this question clearly shows that they are not interested in learning or improving their abilites at all. They simply wish to be done with their homework. This is demonstrated by the fact that they do not even specify which part of the assingment they are having trouble with and simply ask for someone to do it for them. The fact that this question is subpar is also shown through the responses to the question, as the beggining line of the top response is "You should go off and do your own homework to help you learn. " This shows that those who are willing to help only want to do so if they feel they are helping someone improve, not to help them slack off

## Final Thoughts
In conclusion, the benefits of asking smart questions are quite clear. Not only will it help you grow more in whatever skill you are trying to improve in, but it also will allow you to engage more witht the person who is answering your question, as they will be more inclined to help you if they see you are serious about trying to find an answer and improve. The difference in the level of quality between answers of the questions shown really exemplifies that fact. I hope you will utilize these strategies in the future to improve your skills whenver you need to ask a question!
