Coding is, generally speaking, about as granular of an activity as one can partake in, as so because of that, trying to learn about different aspects of it can be extremely intimidating. Not only beacause the concepts themselves can be extremely challenging, but also because a lot of the time they require some prexisting knowledge in order to be implemented effectively. And so, a lot of times the best way to solve a problem you might be having is to ask someone who knows more than you for some help in explaing how to do something or why something behaves the way it does. In that, however, lies a problem, as you dont want to waste either you time or those who are helping you's time. The solution to that problem is to ask questions the "smart way"


## What is a "smart question"

While Social Media certainly allows for unparralled access to communication for people of all ages, it has also served to greatly harm young people, specifically teenagers. I've seen personally, and many study have shown that prolific use of social media correlates very strongly with the development of mental illness in teens and young adults. If we want this extremely powerful tool to help solve lonliness instead of causing it, we have to push for reform that doesn't pray on the fragile psychology of young children in order to create addicts.

## Example of a smart question
A great example of a smart question can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-processing-an-unsorted-array)


## Example of a non-smart question
It is the responsibilty of those in the tech field to make sure that the progress we a pushing for is actually progress, and not actually negatively impacting the world more than it is helping. It will be hard, but it takes a conserted effort from all involved to make change, so if you are not fighting for it, you are fighting against it. I hope that in 50 years we will look back and reflect on the benefits from 2020s technology and not the donwsides.
