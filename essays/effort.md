## Method of Estimating

In order to make my estimates, I looked at past experiences I’ve had in coding and, based on what I remembered from those, made my best guess on the amount of time it took me to complete similar tasks. Afterwards, I considered whether there were any special factors to account for and made any necessary adjustments to my estimation. For example, when I designed the navbar, I had to spend extra time finding or creating the logo we would use, which added a bit of time to the task.

## Benefits of Estimates

I think there were a lot of benefits to making these estimations. The biggest and most obvious benefit is that it allowed me to more effectively budget the amount of time I needed to complete the work assigned to me. Just having a ballpark idea of how long something would take made me more aware of where and when I should work on the project to ensure it was completed on time. The only downside I can see is that if you severely underestimate how long something will take, you might find yourself in a situation where you can't finish on time because you cut it too close.

## Benefits of Tracking

The biggest benefit I found from the actual tracking was that it made me more conscious of how long tasks actually took and how accurate or inaccurate my estimates were. It helped me realize that I needed to be better at budgeting my time so I didn’t end up with too much to do and not enough time to do it. The only potential downside was that I might have become a little too focused on how much time things were taking, but I don’t think it was a major issue.

## Method and Accuracy of Tracking

The method I used was to keep a stopwatch running while I worked, pausing it and marking down the time if I had to take a break or do something else in the meantime. I believe this was a fairly accurate way of tracking my work time, though there were a few moments where the accuracy may have slipped. For example, there were times when I took a few minutes to listen to a song or rest my eyes without stopping the timer, so the total recorded time is probably a bit lower than the actual time spent.

## Overhead

The time it took to set up this tracking system was almost nothing, so it goes without saying that this is an extremely efficient way to start and manage a project. It took maybe five minutes to set up in the beginning, and then another 30–45 seconds each time I started or finished a section of the project.
