# The Role of AI in Software Engineering Education: A Reflection on ICS 314

## I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping the educational landscape, particularly in fields like Software Engineering. In ICS 314, I made use of tools such as Chatgpt and Deepseek  for learning, coding support, and problem-solving. This essay explores my personal experiences with AI in this course, its impact on my understanding, and its broader implications for software engineering education.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

### 1. Experience WODs (e.g. E18)
For the experience wods I would mostly use AI simply to answer questions. I tried to avoid using it to directly write code as I saw the at-home WODs as the best way to introduce and apply concepts that we were learning in the modules, and did not want to risk not understanding something by bypassing it with AI. If I did happen to have a problem that the screencast couldn't answer i would then turn to AI to help answer questions.

### 2. In-class Practice WODs  
Similar to the above, I generally avoided using AI on the practice WODs because of how i viewed them as a tool that would enable me to learn about our curren area of study. I would use it to generate code that I knew i could write just to reduce time or to answer a question I didn't know, but would avoid having it do anything new.

### 3. In-class WODs  
For the Inclass WODs I would make much more extensive use of AI to help me get the WOD done within the timeframe, though I would try to make sure that I didn't overly rely on it because i found that if i did i could focus too much on trying to use AI to do the entire thing and would waste more time than i would save.

### 4. Essays  
For Essays, I would mostly use it to check for grammar and spelling mistakes, which is what i will do for this project. As well, I used it to generate rough outlines for essays, like this one where i had it make the format for this Markdown file with the subheadings. This made it easy to start and to get words on the page.

### 5. Final Project  
For the Final Project, I mostly used AI to help me with debugging a problem that i was encountering. There were a couple points where we as a group had a problem with something like connecting to a database and using AI in those spots helped us to more quickly fix the problem that we were facing.

### 6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial  
I felt like the Modules did a pretty good job explaining what we were learning about, so I didn't really have to use AI to help explain stuff to me. The exception would probably be the points in class where the proffessor explcitly told us to use AI, but other than that i really didn't

### 7. Answering a Question in Class or on Discord  
As mentioned above, the Proffesor would frequently ask us to use AI to answer questions in class, and so in those circumstances i would defenitely use AI. I think it definetely helped at certain points to explain in more detail what we were talking about in class, especially if the topic was more complex and difficult to digest.

### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question  
I don't believe I ever asked or answered a Smart question so I cannot really commennt on its application in this regard. 

### 9. Coding Example (e.g., “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”)  
I'm not sure that I used AI this way in this class so i once again cannot comment on it.

### 10. Explaining Code  
Whenever we first started using the Next-JS, there were a lot of pieces of it that I did not understand, so whenever i came to a new piece of something like a prisma framwork or something like that, i would plug it into a AI to help explain it to me. This helped a lot by breaking down each part of the code individually and explaining what each part of it did.

### 11. Writing Code  
It think AI is a lot better a modifying code you write to fix any mistakes that may have been made, as opposed to wholly writing code on its own. I've found that without the proper context of the surrounding environment it can end up writing code that is at odds with other things that you have written. It also sometimes will just formatt things incorrectly, like when trying to ask it to fix the layout of a webpage for example.

### 12. Documenting Code  
AI does a good job of organizing code and adding in-line comments to make code easier to explore for future readers and if you happen to need to change something in the future or to add to it. Although, a lot of times you will have to prompt it well to get the documentation to be as good as it can be.

### 13. Quality Assurance (e.g., “What’s wrong with this code?” or ESLint fixes)  
I think this is probably the single most useful application of AI in terms of Software Development. Not only will it fix any issues that you made have added to the code but it will explain it to you so you know what the problem is and how you should go about fixing it. Solving ES lint errors is also extremely helpful and steamlines the finals steps of the development proccess.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

I'm not sure that AI has had a huge impact on my learning in this class, but i do think it does a good job at taking out some of the tedium that can be associated with software development. Stuff like identifying errors and fixing syntax errors, while a somewhat important skill to have, can be a major timesink, so being able to quickly move past those points allow for more time learning and understanding the actual application parts that we are working on.

## IV. Practical Applications

I haven't used AI outside of class, but from what i have seen and heard from friends it does seems to work well there, and its only going to become more and more essential to being a successful software developer in the future. Being able to apply both the use of AI and traditional software development skills in unison in the current direction of the field and is as such and essential skill to develop.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

In terms of Obstacles, I would say the most obvious one is the poetential for AI to replace learning in its entierty if one is not careful. Overrealiance cant result in you failing to learn how to do certain things by simply having the AI do it for you. Lacking the fundamental knowledge of how something works means that you won't have the know how to fix it if the AI does something wrong, rendering both you and the AI helpless in that scenario.

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Traditional teaching methods helped me understand things more deeply, especially when I had to figure stuff out on my own during WODs or projects. AI made things feel faster and more engaging, especially when I was stuck or needed help explaining something like a new framework. I found that I learned best when I used AI to support my work instead of doing everything for me. Using both together felt like the most effective way to actually learn and get better at software engineering.
## VII. Future Considerations

I think AI use in education will only continue to become more and more impactful as it continues to be intergrated into more and more courses as a fundamental piece of the curriculum. I think an area that improvement needs to be strived for is finding a way to make sure that AI is not used to avoid learning, as that would not only waste the poetential benefits provided by AI, but actively be catostrophic to ones ability to code effectively.

## VIII. Conclusion

Overall, I think AI was a helpful tool in ICS 314, but only when I made sure to use it the right way. It saved time, explained confusing topics, and helped me get through some of the more frustrating parts of coding, but it couldn't replace the learning I got from actually doing things myself. What I learned is that AI is best when it's used to support—not replace—the skills we’re building in class. If I keep using it that way, I think it’ll be a big help going forward in both school and eventually in the workplace.
