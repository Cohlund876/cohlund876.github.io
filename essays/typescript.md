As someone who had little experience with javascript and almost no experience with Typsescript, I have come to enjoy it in the brief time that i have used it thus far. Coming from C and C++, Typescript is much more intuitive and i find myself at a loss for what my mistake might have been considerably less often then in did when i was utilizing C. Typescript playground is also a nice tool to have for a language. It is very convinient to have a browser based editor and compilor that error checks in real time. It makes it so i don't have to compile and fix and compile and fix a bunch of times in a row in order to find a problem with any code that i have written. 

## Interesting Feature
While i haven't really been able to utilize the fact that classes are treated as first class and can therefore be passed and store like any other variable could be, it does seem like a very interesting and useful function of the language. It makes Typescript feel to be an extremely versatile language as it allow you to do things that just are not possible in other languages. Prototypical Object Orientation also seems interesting. I wonder how it will compare to standard object orientation and which one of the two i will end up preffering after i have gotten anquainted with it.

## Class learning style
As for the class so far, I think it has some things that i really like and things that i have not yet gotten use to. On the positive side, i appreciate that a lot of the learning is done outside of class as that allows me to work at my own pace and then i can ask questions in class if i need to. I also appreciate the oppurtunity to do practive WODS in person during classes and on our own. I think they do a good job preparing you for the actual ones during the week and they help to develop the programming skills we are going to need for this class later on. The biggest thing i'm having difficulty with thus far is the irregular schedule we keep in regards to when things are due, as it makes it harder to plan out my week as i have to shuffle things around at different times.

## Conclusion
Overall, i'd say i'm thus far excited to continue to learn both in this calss and in Typescript. They both seem interesting and i'm sure that i will develop a lot of good skills with them.
