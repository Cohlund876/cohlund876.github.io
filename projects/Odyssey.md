Odyssey of the Mind is an international educational program that fosters creativity and critical thinking in students. Teams of students, typically from elementary to college level, work together to solve open-ended problems that require them to think outside the box. These problems often involve elements of science, technology, engineering, art, and performance.

Through this collaborative process, students develop essential skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and presentation. They learn to embrace challenges, experiment with different approaches, and persevere through setbacks. Odyssey of the Mind encourages innovation and originality, empowering students to become creative problem-solvers and lifelong learners.

My Team went to states all four years, doing a variety of different challenges. One of the Challenges we participated in rquired us to use an arduino to articulate a robot in time with a skit, and to be in precise time with everyone involved.
