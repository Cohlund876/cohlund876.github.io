Overview:
Manoa‚Äôs Got Music is a web application designed to connect musically inclined students at the University of Hawai ªi. The goal was to address a common issue: although many students have musical talent, they often lack a convenient way to find others with similar tastes and compatible skill levels for collaboration or jam sessions.

My Role:
As a core developer on the team, I contributed to both the frontend and backend, helped implement user profile and filtering features, and participated in UI/UX refinement based on community feedback.

Key Features:

üéµ Create musical profiles including genres, instruments, and goals


üîç Browse and filter other musicians by interests and availability

üì¨ Contact users to organize jam sessions and potential collaborations

Technologies Used:

Next.js & TypeScript ‚Äì Full-stack framework for dynamic routing and performance

React & React Bootstrap ‚Äì UI component libraries for clean and responsive design

React Hook Form ‚Äì Form handling with validation

Prisma ORM ‚Äì Type-safe database interactions with PostgreSQL

Vercel ‚Äì Cloud deployment with CI integration

Project Impact:
This project fostered creativity and community within the UH music scene, offering students an accessible way to meet like-minded peers, explore new genres, and build musical connections. Beyond the technical implementation, we engaged in community testing with real users, gathering feedback that led to key improvements like better mobile responsiveness and future plans for in-app messaging and a public events calendar.

What I Learned:
This experience was a deep dive into collaborative full-stack development and reinforced the importance of issue-driven project management (IDPM), iterative testing, and designing for real users. I also gained practical experience in database design, deployment pipelines, and handling feedback loops to improve product quality over time.
