summary: "Helped put on a Hackathon in my senior year of High School"
---

During my senior year of high school, I took a leading role in organizing and producing a weekend-long Hackathon hosted on campus. The event brought together students from various backgrounds—coders, designers, and problem-solvers—to collaborate on building functional software and hardware projects within a tight timeframe. My responsibilities included helping coordinate logistics, promoting the event, assisting with participant registration, and ensuring teams had the resources and mentorship they needed to succeed.

The hackathon fostered an inclusive and inspiring environment, welcoming both experienced programmers and first-time participants. It encouraged creativity, rapid prototyping, and innovative thinking under pressure, while also promoting peer learning and community-building. Watching students turn rough ideas into working solutions within 24–36 hours was a powerful reminder of the impact of collaboration and open access to technology.

This experience deepened my appreciation for the intersection of tech and community, and sharpened my skills in event planning, teamwork, and technical facilitation—all of which I continue to carry into my current work.
