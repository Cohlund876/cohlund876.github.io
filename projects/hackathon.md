summary: "Helped put on a Hackathon in my senior year of High School"
---

Helped to set up and produce a Hackathon hosted by my school in my senior year of high school. A hackathon is an event where programmers, designers, and other interested individuals collaborate intensively on software or hardware projects. Hosted over the course of several hours on a weekend, participants worked together to solve problems, and to create software that is functional by the end of the event. Hackathons foster creativity, innovation, and rapid prototyping, providing a valuable opportunity for learning, networking, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. They also help to create a welcoming and inclusive environment in the area of proggraming.
