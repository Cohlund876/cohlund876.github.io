I belive that coding standards, like any other writing standard, overall serve to improve the readability of something quite substantially. Not only that, I think that after the intial shock of first applying these standards has subsided, it will then actually result in an increase to the speed and productivity of the coder as well. My first week utilizing EsLint has only reaffirmed my feelings on this point.

## On Readability

This first, biggest, and most obvious benefit to the use of Coding standards and EsLint in general is an improvement to the readabilty of the code that you write. Just like using a seriff vs non-seriff font or single vs double spacing on an essay for school, it may seem like these changes are arbitrary, but they do truthfully make it much easier on the eyes and the brain. While some changes, even to me, may seem to have no functional reason for that rule, for example single vs double quotes in EsLint, those concessions are fine because the uniform standard of the code is produced allows me to quickly follow what is happening in the code and where i would need to look for anything that i am trying to find. Concise and consistent spacing particularly helps in my opinion.

## On Productivity 
That increase in readability also allows for a noticiable increase in productivity while coding itself. While it is nice to be able to see someone elses code and be able to decipher it quickly, It is, in my opinion, considerably more helpful to be able to quickly scan your own code. Whether it be for a logic error or just to be able to jog your memories on exactly how i implemented something, i am having to go back to check my code constantly. This time really piles up, so any reduction in the time in which it takes to do that will go a long way in making that go faster. That is the beauty of a coding standard that you are used to. Once you know it, you know where to look to find out what you need to, which lets you get back to coding faster, and then check that code faster for another reason later, and on and on. It building upon itself like that is the reason it is such a good idea to stick to a rigid coding standard.


## Finally
I find coding standards to be incredibly helpful, both to me and to others who might have to look at my code, whoever those poor souls may be. After using EsLint for a short time, i find my feelings on it to be the same as they have been for other coding standards i have used in the past, that being extremely positive. Organized code leads to an organized mind, which leads to success!
