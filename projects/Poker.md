summary: "Developed a Playable version of Five Card Draw which allowed people to bet."
---

As the capstone project for one of my high school programming classes, I developed a fully functional video poker game based on 5-card draw. Designed with both casual and competitive modes in mind, the game allowed players to either play solo—similar to traditional video poker machines—or compete against up to three computer-controlled opponents.

Each opponent could be individually configured to one of three difficulty levels:

Easy: Played conservatively, only keeping pairs and folding otherwise, without placing bets.

Medium: Featured a more strategic approach, betting when holding a strong hand.

Hard: Used advanced game theory principles, employing a Game Theory Optimizer to mimic real-world poker strategies.

The program also included a persistent profile system that tracked player statistics, winnings, and losses across multiple sessions and supported multiple user profiles. To make the game accessible to beginners, I incorporated a short tutorial covering the rules of poker, along with a built-in hand evaluator tool that identified the player's current hand and its relative strength.

This project not only allowed me to practice object-oriented programming and basic AI behavior but also challenged me to think critically about user experience, interface design, and long-term data management.
