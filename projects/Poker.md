summary: "Developed a Playable version of Five Card Draw which allowed people to bet."
---

Developed as the final project for one of my high school programming classes, this game allowed you to play 5 card draw video poker, either against no one, such as in most video poker machine you can find today, or against 1-3 Computer controlled opponents. Each individual opponent could be set to one of 3 difficulties, easy, which only kept pairs in its hand and shuffled back everything else, as well as never betting. Medium, which was more complex and bet when it had a strong hand, and hard, which played advanced poker using a Game Theory Optimizer. The Program kept track of your winnings/losses in between sessions and can keep track of multiple different profiles. The game also featured a short tutorial that explains the basic rules of poker, as well a a tool to tell you what you have and what the releative strength of that hand is.
